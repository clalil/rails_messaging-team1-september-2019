## The code   
This repository contains our team's solution to the Legacy Code Challenge; a web-based application that allows users to sign up, login, create, send and trash emails. This was a one week challenge using Ruby on Rails as well as the gems [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) and Warden (for login and sign up functionality).
